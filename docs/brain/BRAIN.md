### ideas
- Create a fake terminal where there will be written 
```bash
ls
# projects     about     contact

whoami
# andrei

# andrei.dev
```


# projects 

## style

*can open project “folders” with animation or modals styled like Notepad or VIM.*

```js
📁 projects/
├── andrei_shopify_connector
│   └── README.md → “Shopify invoicing solution...”
├── bigcommerce_sync
│   └── README.md → “Multi-store SaaS connector...”
```
